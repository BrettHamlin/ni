## Scope note

This diff may be one progressive-review cluster from a larger PR. Do not mark
registrations, definitions, imports, package `bin` entries, or command wiring
as missing solely because they are absent from this cluster. Make that blocking
only when the provided diff/context explicitly proves CLI behavior is broken or
build/test evidence confirms it; otherwise report the uncertainty as
non-blocking.

Build/test stages are the authoritative gate for compile, bundling,
typecheck, and import-resolution failures. Do not assign D/F for "missing
definition", "undefined symbol", "will not compile", "missing package export",
or "import target absent" based only on absence from this cluster. Surface
those as info/advisory unless build/test evidence is present. Cross-file semantic
concerns that build cannot prove, including command contract drift,
exit-code changes, stdout/stderr inversion, argument forwarding, or flag
parsing behavior changes, remain in scope at warning/error severity when the
reviewed diff supports them.

## What to check

- New commands and flags have a clear contract: accepted inputs, defaults,
  validation errors, exit codes, help text, and documented examples.
- Script-facing stdout stays stable and machine-readable when the command is
  likely to be used in pipes or automation.
- Default behavior is part of the command contract. Treat existing stdout and
  stderr bytes as public script-facing API unless the diff or task explicitly
  shows an intentional default-behavior change. Byte-level changes including
  trailing newlines, delimiters, ordering, quoting, or default formatting are
  blocking when they break scripts.
- Errors go to stderr, successful command output goes to stdout, and exit codes
  distinguish success, user error, cancellation, and internal failures.
- Argument forwarding preserves user intent. Do not silently drop, reorder, or
  reinterpret flags passed after `--` or command-specific positional args.
- Package `bin` entries, generated dist paths, and command names stay aligned
  when a command is added, renamed, or moved.
- Non-interactive commands do not unexpectedly require a TTY, prompt the user,
  or depend on local machine state that the command contract did not require.
- Tests cover the command contract, including at least one error path when the
  feature adds validation or command routing.

## Severity anchors

- **F/error:** a command can report success after failing, executes a different
  package-manager command than requested, writes interactive prompts into
  script output, or changes an existing flag/exit-code contract in a way that
  breaks automation.
- **D/error:** a new command or flag accepts unsafe input, emits success output
  on stderr/stdout incorrectly, loses argument forwarding, regresses an
  existing command's default stdout/stderr bytes without an explicit
  intentional default-behavior change, or leaves package `bin`/dist wiring
  inconsistent with the documented command.
- **C/warning:** minor help text, output consistency, or narrow test coverage
  gap.
- **A:** no command-contract concerns in the diff.
